Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browser interactions, but it can also be easily detected by websites as a bot if not used carefully. Here are some tips to streamline Selenium and make it less likely to be detected as a bot:

    Use the latest version of Selenium: Selenium updates often with improvements to its automation capabilities and bug fixes. It's important to use the latest version to minimize the risk of detection.

    Mimic human-like behavior: Try to simulate human-like behavior when interacting with websites. For example, include random pauses between clicks, scroll down the page, and avoid rapid repetitive actions.

    Vary user agents: User agents identify the browser being used to access the website. Varying the user agent can make it less likely for the website to identify Selenium as a bot.

    Use proxy servers: Proxy servers can mask the IP address of the machine running Selenium, making it harder for websites to detect it as a bot.

    Avoid using default Selenium settings: Websites can easily identify the default settings used by Selenium. Change the default settings such as screen resolution, browser window size, and browser language to minimize detection.

    Use headless mode: Headless mode allows you to run Selenium without opening a browser window, making it harder to detect as a bot.

    Monitor and adjust: Monitor the performance of your Selenium automation and adjust accordingly if any issues arise.

It's important to note that while these tips can help minimize detection, it's still possible for websites to detect Selenium as a bot. Always check the website's terms of service and use Selenium responsibly.
